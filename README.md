## Extra Functionality â€“ Late Fee Charging
An additional feature has been implemented to charge late fees for overdue books:

- When borrowing a book, the date is recorded.

- If a book is not returned on time, a $1 per day late fee is applied.
 
- The fee is displayed to the user when returning the book and reset after payment.

This functionality ensures that users are charged for overdue books, simulating a real-world library system.
